Some various scripts I'm storing here, they might be helpful to someone

Used for the game bitburner, with a github repo here: https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src

You can play the game here: https://bitburner-official.github.io/


Scripts:
- A script that gets every single available server, its data, and its parent
- A script that uses every available server to run one script based on the scripts ram
